# JAMES ODDY
<br>

I am a passionate and dynamic **Full Stack Junior Developer** who recently graduated Makers Academy. I have recently moved into tech after studying environment & development geography and working in Marketing & PR. 

Software development encompasses all of my interests: challenging environments with the potential to alleviate global issues; collaboration with people on exciting new ideas and an environment where active learning of new tech is encouraged. I am looking for a role where I can strengthen what I have learned so far and continue to learn to enhance my knowledge of software development.

**Tech Skills**: Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Heroku, Sinatra, Node.js, jQuery, React, Twitter API, Google Maps API

## Skills<br>

#### Excellent communicator

During my time working in public relations and marketing, I liased with clients, journalists and the general public on a daily basis. Since then I have continued to further develop and refine both my verbal and written communication skills for software development through daily pairing and working in teams to complete projects.

#### Great team player

I have always thrived working within teams, both professionally in a work environment and academically at Makers Academy and university. I have particularly enjoyed working as part of a team to complete software development projects for events like hackathons. 

#### Fast learner

Makers Academy bootcamp is a short intensive course of only 12 weeks, while I was there I learned 4 new languages. As well as this, I developed vital experience working to the deadline of a final project under tight time frames remotely during the Covid-19 pandemic. For this project we had less than two weeks to complete it, during this time I developed a deep understand of Rails, testing on Rails and deployment with Heroku and Travis. 

#### Analytical thinker

For my MA degree thesis I wanted to identify an issue that had not been extensively covered and understand why the issue exists. For this I decided to investigate why air pollution levels are so high on the London Underground and if everyday commuters were aware of this, this involved collecting and analysing air pollution data from the London Underground and survey responses.

## Hobbies & Interests<br>

- Photography (film & digital). 
- Art. I'm a member of various art galleries & love seeing new exhibitions, I find it provides the perfect quiet space for creative inspiration.  
- Yoga. Best way to destress and renergize after a day full of coding, often so effective I end up coding for hours after.
- Gardening. Pottering around the garden, often includes beekeeping. Good exercise & is the perfect unblocker.
